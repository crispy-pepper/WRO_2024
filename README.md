## Task 
Build a self-driving, autonomous vehicle that completes 2 challenges: the open challenge and the obstacle challenge. <br>

## Our Approach
### Open Challenge
The open challenge is where the car must complete three full laps around the field. The size of each side of the field is determined by random chance of either 100 cm or 60 cm. The direction in which the car drives is also randomized. <br>
Our approach to this challenge was to detect the walls, turn when one wall disappears, and count the number of turns to know when to end. <br><br>



### Obstacle Challenge

## Engineering materials
### Car Base
* Carisma 80468 GT24RS 1/24 4WD On-Road Brushless RTR Retro Rally Car as the structure, and steering system of the car
* Komodo Motor
* Hitec HS-5055MG Servo
* Furitek Lizard Pro ESC
* Gens Ace 2S1P 1300mAh 7.4V battery
* Rasberry PI 4 Model B
* Raspberry Pi Multi-function Expansion Board 
* Rasberry PI fan
* 3d printed base
### Open Challenge
* SainSmart Camera Module RPi3, 5MP, Fish-Eye
### Obstacle Challenge
* SainSmart Camera Module RPi3, 5MP, Fish-Eye


## Content

- `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
- `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
- `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
- `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
- `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
- `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
- `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
